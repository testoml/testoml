# ðŸ‘‹ Hi
I'm Ornella Luna for the past decade, I've been dedicated to Quality Assurance, honing my skills to ensure product excellence. Over the last two years, I transitioned into the role of Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), where I've excelled in leveraging Cypress, Selenium, and C# technologies. In addition to my core responsibilities, I've actively contributed to various aspects of the development lifecycle. This includes refining processes, crafting comprehensive test plans and suites, and diligently maintaining control measures. My efforts have significantly bolstered our Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines, fostering a culture of efficiency and reliability within the team.

# ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested
I am keen on expanding my expertise and refining my skills, particularly in JavaScript, Continuous Integration (CI), and API development. I'm eager to deepen my understanding and proficiency in these areas to further advance my career and contribute effectively to projects.
